# Test routines

## Overview
Tests to check that my utility functions and helper classes are working as intended.
I try to have full coverage of all utility functions, but these aren't real unit tests, so I do the best I can.

### Utilities covered by tests
arg_helper
dijet_definition
dijet_key
dijet_matrix
dijet_worker
jet_def
match_def
reader_util
