# Monte-carlo methods

## Overview
This subproject holds my one-off monte-carlo scripts (running pythia, etc). I keep this seperate from my "real" data analysis scripts for
clarity. Any MC that would be shown as a physics result will be implemented in the analysis subproject.

### pythia_aj_efficiency.cc && print_pythia_eff_results.cc
Performs the AJ analysis on pythia with different efficiencies, to see the effect efficiencies have on the hard AJ shape.
print_pythia_eff_results overlays the results and prints the comparisons.
