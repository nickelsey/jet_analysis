# Efficiency helper functionality

## Overview
This subproject holds classes that implement our efficiency corrections for different years, and ratios between AuAu & pp, as well as any code
needed to generate those corrections.

### run4_eff.hh
Implements efficiencies for run 4 Au+Au and run 6 p+p. This was only used as an example (and a failed example at that) and should not be
used for actual analyses.
